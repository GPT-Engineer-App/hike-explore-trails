# hike-explore-trails

An iOS application for hiking featuring OAuth login, a landing page with an empty iframe widget, a collapsible menu for searching pre-mapped trails, and additional pages for future information. The design aims for a user-friendly interface, likely incorporating nature-inspired colors and easy-to-read fonts, to enhance the user experience for hikers looking to explore trails. The layout should prioritize easy navigation and accessibility, with the potential for incorporating user feedback to refine trail searches and information presentation.
